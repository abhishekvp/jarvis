A Voice Enabled Personal Assistant for Simple Tasks

This is a pretty basic voice enabled personal assistant that I had put together a long time back (after watching the Iron Man movie :P). It is crude and relies on simple if - else statements in the shell script. I plan to improve it over time. 

Feel free to try it out and contribute to it!
